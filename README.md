1) What was the objective of the project?
   The Objective was to show the a list of sponsors of a drug along with their application number.  I'm imagining that an easy way to cross reference this for someone working at the FDA would find this useful.
   
2) How did you accomplish the object?
  I accomplished this by creating that list along with a search that can narrow down the results.
3) Technical details:
• What was the front-end framework?
  The framework used was React
• What were the sub-packages?
  Sub-packages I used were:
    gh-pages: to deploy to github 
    react-smart-data-table: to display the data and provide other advanced functionality
• How do we install and test your code?
    This front-end is live on github pages here https://pnguy55.github.io/Drugs-FDA/
